title: Mogrify to batch resize images
---

The ```mogrify``` command can be used to batch convert images in a variety of ways
including format conversions, resize, etc.  I'm primarily interested in resize.

First, mogrify is provided by imagemagick:

```apt-get install imagemagick```

Then use it to resize: 

```mogrify -resize 50% -format jpg *```
