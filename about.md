Fourty-something software engineer moonlighting as a flight instructor.  

### Pilot Stuff

Commercial Pilot ASEL, CFI/CFII.  

## Teaching

I teach actively - usually carrying a couple students.

I am currently teaching out of KOAK - Oakland, CA - however in transition to 
KMSN - Madison, Wisconsin.

Hit my up if you's like a BFR or IPC in your aircraft.  I've got plenty of 
time in 172s, the whole cherokee family - Arrow, Turbo Arrow, Archer, 235; 
Grumman Tiger, Rockwell Commander.  I'm happy to fly just about anything 
with 2 seats and a motor.

### Software Stuff

I'm formally trained as a real engineer, but haven't done that in a long time.

These day I still enjoy Java, devops in AWS - and related BS.
